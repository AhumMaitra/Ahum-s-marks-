# Student Marks Viewer

This project is a simple web application that allows users to view student marks based on their roll number, name, selected term, subject, and class. It provides an interactive interface for retrieving and displaying academic results.

## Files Overview

- **index.html**: Contains the HTML structure of the application, including a form for entering the roll number, name, pin, term, subject, and class selection. It also includes a button to show results and a container to display the results.

- **script.js**: Contains the JavaScript logic for the application. It defines a `students` object with student data, a `showResults` function to display marks based on user input, and a `createResultItem` function to format the results for display. This file includes functionality for selecting different classes and pin lock authentication.

- **style.css**: Contains the CSS styles for the application, styling the body, container, headings, input fields, buttons, and result items to create a visually appealing layout. It also includes styles for required fields and pin input.

## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
2. Enter the roll number, name, and pin of the student.
3. Select the desired class, term, and subject from the dropdown menus.
4. Click the "Show Results" button to view the marks.
5. The results will be displayed in the results container below the form.

## Future Enhancements

- Implement additional features such as exporting results to a file.
- Add more student data for comprehensive testing.
- Improve the user interface for better usability.
